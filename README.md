🍼🌸 Introducing BabyBliss – A Caring Shopping Experience for New Moms
I’m happy to share my Mobile Application Development project: BabyBliss, a calm and thoughtfully designed Android app that helps mothers of small babies easily discover and purchase baby food and essential baby products.
BabyBliss combines a soft, nurturing visual style with smooth interactions and practical features to create a comforting, mom-friendly shopping experience.

      Gentle, baby-themed UI with soft colors and clean layouts
      Curated sections for baby food, formula, snacks, and daily essentials
      Smooth navigation and well-structured screens for quick, stress-free browsing
      Clear product presentation to support confident and informed choices
💻 Tech Stack & Tools

🎯 What I Learned While Building BabyBliss
      Designing UI/UX specifically for parents with limited time and high priorities
      Creating intuitive navigation and flows for product discovery and checkout
      Writing clean Kotlin code and organizing the app structure for scalability
      Using color, spacing, and typography to support a calm and trustworthy brand

This project allowed me to combine empathy, design, and development — turning the idea of a supportive shopping companion for mothers into a functional, polished Android app.
❤ BabyBliss is all about making it easier for moms to care for their little ones, with the right products just a few taps away.
